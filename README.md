# âš¡ FPGA-based HVAC Control System

> By Rawsab Said and Muneeb Farrukh

## About the project:
* We utilized behavioral VHDL to develop an interactive HVAC system on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) board utilizing custom-designed components, such as binary counters, bidirectional shift registers, multiplexers, and comparators.
* Moreover, we  integrated the FPGA-based HVAC system with existing hardware, allowing user control through switches and push buttons and also allowed for visual feedback through light-emitting diodes and seven-segment programming.
